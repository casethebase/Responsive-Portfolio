# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Welcome to my second project ever with the UT coding bootcamp. As you may be able to tell by looking at this repo -- not enough time was spent fleshing out all the containers and sizes. 

I did, however, manage to get some media queries in there - to demonstrate that I do know how to call them. 

This was a challenging exercise, moreso even than the Javascript homework (which I've actually already begun work on)

To whomever grades this work: have mercy on my soul.
